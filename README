== About ==

transpress is a fast, multi-process compression format converter.
It converts a directory of raw/gz/bz2 files into bz2/raw/gz files.

Different compression formats have different time/space characteristics,
and it's sometimes desirable to convert large datasets to a different format
that's more optimal for what you're planning to do. For instance,
bzip2's decode is often much slower than the disk; it can be better to
use gzip or lzma in that case.

Of course, you can convert with a simple UNIX pipe such as:

    bzip2 -dc foo.bz2 | gzip >foo.gz

And on a multicore system, the kernel will schedule
bzip2 and gzip on different cores, providing some paralliem.
But because the decompressor is faster than compressor,
one core will be partially idle. That's inefficient.

So, transpress runs the compression and decompression on the same core,
and gets parallelism out of processing different files on different cores.
This provides 100% CPU utilization on all cores, and
is usually substantially faster than the pipe approach.

Of course, you could still do this with a shell script
that runs multiple pipes, but IMO it's nicer to just do
it in C.

== Compiling ==

    apt-get install libbz2-dev zlib1g-dev liblzma-dev
    make
    cp transpress /usr/local/bin

== Usage ==

    transpress [dir] [infmt] [outfmt]

    Ex: transpress /home/user/data gz bz2
    Ex: transpress /home/user/data bz2 json
        (unknown fmts will be treated as raw binary data)

== Bugs ==

1. Cannot handle files w/ no file extension.
2. Should support lzma + lzop.
3. Some processes can finish earlier than others.
4. Cannot control compression level via the cmd line.
5. No manpages/help/etc.
6. Can't handle infmt==outfmt (i.e. to change compression level)
